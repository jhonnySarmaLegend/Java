/*
Overview

The Callable interface represents a task that can return a result and throw checked exceptions.
It has a single method: V call() throws Exception, where V is the return type of the task.

Key Points:

Return Value: Callable tasks can return a result of a specified type.
Exception Handling: Can throw checked exceptions.
Use Case: Ideal for tasks that need to return a result or handle exceptions.

/*
When to Use Which?

Use Runnable:
For tasks that perform operations without returning a result.
When you donâ€™t need to handle checked exceptions.

Use Callable:
For tasks that need to return a result.
When you need to handle checked exceptions.


Real-World Use Cases

Runnable
Performing background tasks like logging, monitoring, or cleanup operations.
Updating the UI in Swing or JavaFX applications.

Callable
Fetching data from a database or an external API.
Performing computations that return a result, such as calculating the sum of a large dataset.
